## 1. History of Monopoly Hotel and House Pieces

### Origins and the Wooden Era (1935-1960s)

Parker Brothers first published Monopoly on November 5, 1935. The original sets shipped with **wooden houses and hotels** -- small green houses and larger red hotels. This green-and-red color coding has persisted as the dominant visual language for nearly a century. A complete standard set includes **32 green houses** and **12 red hotels**.

Early wooden pieces had a simple gabled-roof form. Some variants featured a slight roof overhang on either side. The wood was typically painted in solid color with no surface detail -- the building type was communicated entirely through color, size, and basic shape.

### Wartime Disruptions (1940s)

During World War II, materials shortages affected all Monopoly components. Metal tokens were replaced with wood pawns, and some sets used composite playing pieces made of compressed paper and sawdust. The houses and hotels, being already wood, were less affected, though quality varied. These wartime-era pieces are now collector's items due to their fragility and rarity.

### Transition to Plastic (1960s-1980s)

Over time, houses and hotels transitioned from wood to **injection-molded polystyrene**. The switch to plastic standardized dimensions and allowed for more consistent manufacturing. The fundamental design -- a simple rectangular building with a peaked/gabled roof -- remained unchanged. What changed was material consistency: every house and hotel in a set was now dimensionally identical.

### Modern Standard Dimensions

The classic Monopoly pieces have been measured by collectors and replacement-part manufacturers:

| Piece | Width | Height | Depth | Metric (approx.) |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| **House** (green) | 1/2" | 1/2" | 1/2" | 12.7 x 12.7 x 12.7 mm |
| **Hotel** (red) | 3/4" | 5/8" | 1/2" | 19 x 16 x 12.7 mm |

Replacement parts from aftermarket suppliers list slightly different measurements (houses at 3/8" x 1/2", or ~9.5 x 12.7 mm; hotels at 5/8" x 1/2", or ~16 x 12.7 mm), reflecting variation across editions and manufacturers. Injection-molded replacement houses weigh approximately **0.5 grams** each with a matte finish.

Key observation: the hotel is differentiated from the house primarily by being **wider** (roughly 1.5x the width) and **slightly taller**, while maintaining the same depth. The hotel reads as "bigger building" rather than "different building."

### Parker Brothers to Hasbro (1991-Present)

Parker Brothers was absorbed into Hasbro in 1991. By Hasbro's count, more than **275 million Monopoly games** have been sold since 1935, including over **6 billion green houses** and **2.25 billion red hotels**. Despite this enormous production run, the fundamental house/hotel design has changed remarkably little.

### Variant Editions and Expanded Building Types

Several editions have introduced new building categories:

- **Monopoly: The Mega Edition** -- Added **Depots** and **Skyscrapers** as building levels above hotels
- **Monopoly City** -- Buildings placed on districts rather than individual properties; up to 8 blocks of residential and industrial buildings per district
- **Monopoly Stock Exchange Edition (2001)** -- Replaced houses/hotels with **offices** and **home offices**
- **Monopoly Here and Now Edition** -- Changed the color scheme to blue and silver instead of green and red
- **Nostalgia/Collector's Editions** -- Returned to wooden pieces with period-appropriate styling

These variants demonstrate that the Monopoly building vocabulary can be extended. However, the core green-house/red-hotel pairing remains the most universally recognized building game piece design in history.

## 2. Other Board Games with Building Pieces

### The Hotel Board Game (MB Games, 1986)

Originally designed by Geoffrey Hayes and published by Denys Fisher Toys in 1974, the Hotel board game (known as "Hotels" in North America) was acquired by Milton Bradley in 1986. It features **3D hotel buildings** assembled from paperboard walls with plastic bases and plastic roof parts.

Key design elements:
- **30 cardboard buildings** with 30 plastic bases and 33 plastic roof parts
- Buildings are themed and named (President, Taj Mahal, Waikiki, Safari, etc.)
- **Stackable additional floors** -- up to four extensions per hotel for five total levels
- **28 plastic entrance markers** shaped as gates
- Leisure facilities (swimming pools, casinos) as add-on pieces

The Hotel game is significant because it demonstrates that players respond strongly to **three-dimensional buildings on a game board**. As one reviewer noted: "While the components only serve a cosmetic role, it is hard to not love the 3D hotel buildings as it feels like you are really building up a boardwalk."

The game was re-released by Asmodee in 2014 as **Hotel Tycoon** with simplified rules and updated artwork.

### Catan (Settlers of Catan, 1995)

Designed by Klaus Teuber, Catan uses abstract building pieces to represent settlements and cities:

| Piece | Dimensions | Material |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Settlement** (house shape) | 14 x 10 x 12 mm | Wood (maple or beech) |
| **City** (church/cathedral shape) | Larger, multi-peaked | Wood |
| **Road** | Flat stick | Wood |

A standard player set includes **5 settlements, 4 cities, and 15 roads**. The settlement is a simple house-shaped piece (rectangular base with a triangular peaked roof). The city is a taller, wider piece with multiple peaked elements -- it reads as "upgraded settlement" through increased size and visual complexity.

Available in many player colors: red, orange, white, blue, black, brown, green, yellow, gray, pink, purple, gold, silver, and bronze. The 10th-anniversary collector's edition (2005) featured hand-painted 3D tiles and playing pieces.

The Catan design language demonstrates an important principle: **at game-piece scale, "more complex silhouette = more advanced building."**

### Carcassonne (2000)

Carcassonne primarily uses meeples (person-shaped pieces) rather than building pieces, but several expansions add architectural elements:

- **The Tower Expansion** -- Tower pieces that stack vertically on tile foundations
- **Little Buildings Expansion** -- 18 building tokens: 6 houses, 6 sheds, and 6 towers, each with distinct silhouettes
- **Towers and Thieves (2025)** -- 20 tower floors and 5 tower tiles

Standard meeple dimensions:
- Travel size: 12 mm tall
- Standard: 16 mm tall, 15 mm wide, 8-10 mm thick
- Mega Meeple: 19 mm tall

Carcassonne tiles measure 45 x 45 mm, providing context for the scale of any building pieces placed on them.

### Other Notable Games with Building Pieces

- **Alhambra** -- Uses cardboard building tiles; one dedicated maker 3D-printed detailed replicas of each building type to replace the flat tiles
- **Power Grid** -- Uses wooden house tokens for power plants
- **Suburbia** -- Hexagonal building tiles rather than 3D pieces
- **Tiny Towns** -- Players construct buildings from resource cubes, with finished buildings represented by small wooden tokens

### Design Language Summary Across Games

| Game | Building Representation | Differentiation Method |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Monopoly | Abstract blocks with peaked roofs | Color + size |
| Hotel (MB) | Assembled 3D structures | Shape + height + name |
| Catan | Abstract wood shapes | Silhouette complexity |
| Carcassonne | Stackable towers, small tokens | Silhouette (house vs shed vs tower) |
| Alhambra | Flat tiles (or 3D printed replacements) | Color + illustration |

## 3. Visual Cues: What Makes a Building "Read" as a Hotel

At miniature game-piece scale (10-20mm), the viewer has extremely limited visual information. The following hierarchy of cues determines what a building "reads as," ordered from most to least effective at tiny scale:

### Primary Cues (Readable at 1-2cm)

1. **Relative Size/Mass** -- Hotels are larger than houses. This is the single most reliable differentiator at Monopoly scale. The classic Monopoly hotel is roughly 1.5x wider than the house.

2. **Color** -- Green = house, red = hotel in the Monopoly convention. Color coding works even when shape detail is lost.

3. **Overall Silhouette/Outline** -- The shape visible against the board surface. A peaked roof reads as "residential." A flat roof or more complex roofline reads as "commercial/institutional."

4. **Height-to-Width Ratio** -- Taller, wider buildings suggest hotels or commercial structures. Narrow, compact buildings suggest houses.

### Secondary Cues (Readable at 1-2cm with Good Printing)

5. **Number of Stories** -- Visible floor lines or window rows suggesting multiple floors. Hotels typically have 3+ uniform stories; houses have 1-2 stories with varied window placement.

6. **Entrance Prominence** -- Hotels feature a prominent, often centered entrance with an awning, canopy, or marquee. Houses have simpler, often off-center doorways.

7. **Roof Form** -- Peaked/gabled = residential; flat or complex = commercial. A mansard roof or hip roof with dormers can suggest a grander hotel. Multiple roof peaks suggest a larger, more complex structure.

8. **Window Pattern** -- Hotels display many uniform, repeating windows across floors (grid pattern). Houses have fewer, varied windows.

### Tertiary Cues (Difficult Below 2cm, but Worth Attempting)

9. **Awning/Canopy at Entry** -- A projecting element at the front entrance is one of the most recognized hotel markers in architectural iconography.

10. **Signage Suggestion** -- Even a small raised rectangle above the entrance can suggest a hotel sign.

11. **Symmetry** -- Hotels tend to be more symmetrical than houses, which often have asymmetric facades.

12. **Ancillary Features** -- A suggested swimming pool, parking area, or landscaping can reinforce the hotel reading, though these are almost impossible to represent below 2cm.

### The Key Insight

At Monopoly scale (10-20mm), **color and relative size do 80% of the work**. The remaining 20% comes from silhouette shape. Fine architectural detail is essentially invisible. This means a procedural generator should prioritize:

1. Getting the overall massing and proportions right
2. Having a clear, distinctive silhouette
3. Including one or two readable features (entry awning, floor lines)
4. Not wasting geometry on details that will not survive printing or viewing at arm's length

## 4. Optimal Proportions for Game Piece Buildings

### Established Standards from Existing Games

Based on measurements of successful commercial game pieces:

| Source | Width | Height | Depth | H:W Ratio |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Monopoly house | 12.7 mm | 12.7 mm | 12.7 mm | 1:1 |
| Monopoly hotel | 19 mm | 16 mm | 12.7 mm | 0.84:1 |
| Catan settlement | 14 mm | 12 mm | 10 mm | 0.86:1 |
| Replacement house (aftermarket) | 12 mm | 9 mm | 8 mm | 0.75:1 |

Several patterns emerge:
- Game piece buildings are typically **wider than they are tall** or approximately square in aspect
- Heights range from **9 to 20 mm** for standard game pieces
- Base depths are typically **60-100% of width**
- Hotels are wider than houses but not necessarily proportionally taller

### Recommended Proportions for Procedural Hotels

Based on the analysis of existing pieces, chess piece stability research (FIDE recommends base diameter at 40-50% of height), and structural stability guidelines:

**For a "small hotel" (Monopoly-style):**
- Target height: **15-20 mm** (including roof)
- Width: **12-18 mm**
- Depth: **10-14 mm**
- Height-to-width ratio: **0.8:1 to 1.2:1**
- Base footprint: at least **60% of the widest cross-section**

**For a "large/landmark hotel":**
- Target height: **18-25 mm**
- Width: **15-22 mm**
- Depth: **12-16 mm**
- Height-to-width ratio: **1.0:1 to 1.5:1**
- Base footprint: at least **70% of the widest cross-section**

### The Stability Ratio

From structural engineering and chess piece design, two key ratios govern stability:

1. **The 1:3 Rule** -- For freestanding structures, the base width should be at least one-third of the total height. A 20mm tall hotel needs a base at least ~7mm wide. This is easily satisfied by most game piece proportions.

2. **The 40-50% Rule** (from FIDE chess standards) -- The base dimension should be 40-50% of the height for robust stability. A 20mm tall piece should have a base at least 8-10mm wide. Again, easily met by building-shaped pieces which are naturally wider at the base.

3. **Center of Gravity** -- The center of mass should be in the lower half of the piece. Building shapes naturally achieve this because roofs are thinner/lighter than building bodies. Solid infill in the base and reduced infill in the upper portions can further help.

### The Golden Ratio and Aesthetic Proportion

The golden ratio (1:1.618) provides a useful starting point for aesthetically pleasing building proportions. For a game piece hotel:

- If the building body is 10mm tall, the roof section should be approximately 6mm tall (total 16mm)
- If the facade is 12mm wide, the building depth could be approximately 7.4mm
- Window spacing and floor heights can follow subdivisions of this ratio

Classical architectural column proportions (1:7 width-to-height for Tuscan/Doric orders) are too slender for stable game pieces. The squat, chunky proportions of real game pieces (roughly 1:1 to 1:1.5 width-to-height) are more appropriate.

## 5. The Role of Silhouette in Game Piece Recognition

### Why Silhouette Dominates at Small Scale

Silhouette -- the outline of an object viewed as a solid shape against a contrasting background -- is the single most important visual property for object recognition at small scale and distance. This principle is well-established in game art, character design, and industrial design.

Key principles from game design theory:

1. **Silhouette removes interior detail, forcing focus on form.** Without surface detail, our brains create simplified mental pictures from shape alone. At 15mm scale, surface detail is nearly invisible -- only the outline remains.

2. **Strong silhouettes allow instant recognition at a glance.** As articulated in game prop design literature: "A strong silhouette allows viewers to recognise a character at a glance, even from a distance." Iconic examples include the Team Fortress 2 character designs, where each class is recognizable purely from silhouette across a game map.

3. **"Having detail everywhere is as good as having no detail at all."** Small details should add visual interest to major silhouette reads, not distort them. For game pieces, this means a few well-chosen features (a peaked roof, an entrance awning) matter more than many tiny features (individual window panes, brick texture).

4. **Negative space is as important as positive space.** The gaps within a silhouette help maintain readability and prevent the design from feeling cluttered. A recessed entrance or an archway creates negative space that makes the building silhouette more interesting and recognizable.

### Shape Language for Buildings

Different basic shapes communicate different building types:

- **Rectangle + Triangle (peaked roof)** = House/residential. This is the most universal "building" symbol.
- **Rectangle + Flat top** = Commercial/modern building.
- **Rectangle + Multiple peaks** = Complex/important building (church, city hall, hotel).
- **Rectangle + Dome** = Civic/religious building.
- **Tall rectangle (tower)** = Skyscraper/high-rise hotel.
- **Stepped/terraced form** = Grand hotel, resort.

### Practical Silhouette Testing

A simple test for any generated hotel piece: **fill the 3D model with solid black in a 2D render and check if it still reads as "hotel."** If the silhouette is ambiguous or could be mistaken for a house, the design needs more differentiation in its outline.

For procedural generation, the silhouette can be evaluated algorithmically:
- Compute the 2D convex hull from the front and side views
- Measure the complexity (number of vertices in the simplified outline)
- Hotels should have **more complex silhouettes** than houses
- Check that the silhouette is **distinctly different** from other building types in the same generation batch

### Silhouette at Distance vs. Close-Up

At board game viewing distance (60-90 cm / 2-3 feet), silhouette and proportions establish instant visual recognition. At closer inspection (picking up a piece), surface detail and texture become visible. This means:

- The silhouette must work at arm's length
- Detail rewards closer inspection but must not be relied upon for identification
- Color acts as a "first filter" before silhouette is even processed

## 6. Color and Material Considerations for 3D Printed Pieces

### Material Comparison for Game Pieces

| Property | PLA | PETG | ABS | Resin (SLA) |
|----------|-----|------|-----|-------------|
| **Ease of Printing** | Excellent | Good | Difficult | Moderate |
| **Detail Resolution** | Good | Good | Good (acetone-smoothable) | Excellent |
| **Color Variety** | Widest range | Moderate (often translucent) | Good | Good |
| **Impact Durability** | Low (brittle) | Good | Best | Low (brittle) |
| **Heat Resistance** | Low (softens ~60C) | Medium | High | Low-Medium |
| **Paintability** | Excellent | Poor | Good | Excellent |
| **Enclosure Needed** | No | No | Yes | N/A |
| **Layer Height (typical)** | 0.1-0.2 mm | 0.1-0.2 mm | 0.1-0.2 mm | 0.025-0.05 mm |
| **Post-Processing** | Sanding, painting | Sanding | Acetone smoothing | Washing, curing |
| **Safety Concerns** | Minimal | Minimal | Fumes, enclosure | Uncured resin is toxic |

### Recommended Materials by Use Case

**PLA -- Best Overall for Prototyping and Light Use**
- Most beginner-friendly; prints at 180-220C without a heated enclosure
- Highest tensile strength (~50-60 MPa) but brittle under impact
- Widest range of vibrant, opaque colors available
- Excellent for painting -- takes acrylic and enamel paints well
- Biodegradable and made from renewable resources (cornstarch, sugarcane)
- **Limitation:** Low impact resistance; thin features (spires, chimneys) can snap

**PETG -- Best for Durable Gaming Pieces**
- Superior impact resistance compared to PLA; pieces less prone to breakage
- Good balance of detail and durability
- Prints at 220-250C; benefits from heated bed but no enclosure needed
- More challenging to get clean prints (stringing issues common)
- Limited color range; often semi-translucent
- **Limitation:** Poor paintability; more calibration needed

**Resin (SLA/DLP) -- Best for Maximum Detail**
- Layer heights as low as 0.025 mm capture details FDM cannot reproduce
- Ideal for showcase pieces and high-detail architectural features
- Prints of multiple pieces at once take the same time as a single piece
- Requires post-processing: washing in IPA, UV curing
- Brittle unless using tough/flexible resin blends
- **Limitation:** Post-processing overhead; uncured resin handling; generally more expensive

**The Hybrid Approach**
Many experienced makers use FDM (PLA) for terrain, large pieces, and rapid prototyping, and resin for detailed miniatures. For hotel game pieces at 15-20mm, FDM with PLA at 0.1mm layer height produces acceptable results. Resin produces superior results but at higher cost and complexity.

### Color Guidance

For traditional Monopoly-style hotels:
- **Red** is the canonical hotel color (Pantone warm red or similar)
- **Green** is the canonical house color
- High-contrast, saturated colors improve visibility at board game distance

For custom/themed hotels:
- Limit the palette to **2-3 colors maximum** per piece to avoid visual clutter at small scale
- **Warm colors** (red, orange, gold) read as "grand" or "premium"
- **Cool colors** (blue, gray, silver) read as "modern" or "corporate"
- **Earth tones** (brown, cream, terracotta) read as "historic" or "resort"
- Painting after printing allows multi-color pieces from single-color filament

### Print Settings for Miniature Hotels (FDM/PLA)

- **Layer height:** 0.1-0.15 mm for best detail-to-speed balance
- **Nozzle size:** 0.4 mm standard; 0.2 mm for finer detail on small features
- **Print speed:** 20-35 mm/s for outer walls; slow down for fine features
- **Infill:** 10-20% for most pieces; 100% for very small pieces to add weight
- **Supports:** Design pieces to print without supports where possible
- **Cooling:** Maximum fan speed for PLA (helps bridge small gaps and overhangs)
- **First layer:** Slow speed to ensure solid adhesion
- **Orientation:** Print with the largest flat surface (base) on the build plate

## 7. Ergonomic Considerations

### The Pickup Problem

Game pieces must be easy to pick up from a flat board surface. This is the primary ergonomic constraint for miniature buildings. Relevant factors:

1. **Minimum graspable size** -- Adult fingers typically need at least 8-10mm of clearance to grip a piece between thumb and forefinger. Pieces shorter than 10mm become frustrating to pick up.

2. **Grip surface** -- A peaked roof provides a natural "pinch point" for picking up the piece. Flat-roofed buildings need some other graspable feature (a raised parapet, a slightly wider roof edge, or sufficient overall height).

3. **Weight** -- Pieces that are too light feel insubstantial and can be displaced by accidental table bumps. Small PLA pieces benefit from higher infill (50-100%) or a weighted base insert.

4. **Surface texture** -- A slightly textured surface (matte PLA, light sanding) provides better grip than a perfectly smooth surface. The natural layer lines of FDM printing actually help here.

### Tip-Over Resistance

Game pieces must resist tipping when:
- Placed on the board
- Bumped by player hands or dice
- Placed on slightly uneven surfaces

Design guidelines for stability:
- **Base width should be at least 40% of height** (from chess piece standards)
- **Center of gravity in the lower third** where possible
- **Flat, full-contact base** -- no wobbly contact points
- **No thin, top-heavy protrusions** (tall chimneys, spires) that shift the center of gravity upward
- **Chamfer or fillet the base edges** to prevent "rocking" on imperfect surfaces

### Board Compatibility

Hotel game pieces need to fit within the property spaces on a game board:
- Standard Monopoly property spaces are 1.5" wide x 2.5" tall (38 x 64 mm)
- Up to 4 houses or 1 hotel must fit in the property-adjacent area
- Custom game boards may have different space sizes

For general-purpose hotel pieces not tied to a specific board:
- Base footprint should not exceed **20 x 15 mm** for standard compatibility
- Height should not exceed **25 mm** to avoid visual obstruction of the board

### Accessibility Considerations

- Color should not be the only differentiator (accommodate color-blind players)
- Different building types should have **tactile differences** (shape, texture) in addition to color
- Pieces should be distinguishable by shape alone when viewed from above (board-level view)

---

## 8. Architectural Styles at Game-Piece Scale

### Which Features Survive Miniaturization

At 15-20mm scale, the following architectural features remain readable:

**Highly Visible (survive well):**
- Overall building mass and proportions
- Roof form (gabled, flat, hipped, mansard, dome)
- Number of stories (visible as horizontal bands or floor lines)
- Entrance recess or porch
- Awning or canopy at entrance (as a simple projecting surface)
- Tower or turret elements
- Balcony rails (as a simple ledge)
- Stepped/terraced massing

**Marginally Visible (require good printing and close inspection):**
- Individual window openings (as recesses or raised frames)
- Cornice lines and string courses (as horizontal ridges)
- Column suggestions (as vertical cylinders)
- Arched openings (if large enough relative to piece)
- Chimney (if sufficiently chunky)

**Invisible/Unprintable (do not attempt):**
- Individual brick or stone texture
- Window mullions or glazing bars
- Door panels or hardware
- Decorative moldings or carvings
- Shingle/tile texture on roofs
- Signage text (illegible below ~5mm letter height)
- Railings or balustrades with individual balusters

### Architectural Styles Ranked by Miniaturizability

**Excellent at Small Scale:**

1. **Art Deco** -- Bold geometric forms, stepped massing, strong vertical and horizontal lines. The stepped-back profile of an Art Deco hotel is immediately recognizable in silhouette. Minimal reliance on fine detail.

2. **Modernist/International Style** -- Clean rectangular volumes, flat roofs, grid-pattern windows (representable as recessed rows). The simplicity translates well to low-detail printing.

3. **Mediterranean/Mission Revival** -- Distinctive clay-tile hip roofs, arched entries, tower elements, and courtyard massing all survive miniaturization well. The warm color palette (terracotta, cream) adds character.

4. **Victorian/Second Empire** -- Mansard roofs, turrets, and varied rooflines create complex, interesting silhouettes. The ornate surface detail is lost, but the overall form remains distinctive.

**Good at Small Scale:**

5. **Colonial/Georgian** -- Symmetrical facades, central entry with portico/pediment, multi-pane windows (representable as a grid of recesses). Simple and dignified.

6. **Gothic Revival** -- Pointed arches, steep gabled roofs, and tower elements create dramatic silhouettes. Fine tracery detail is lost but the overall "castle-like" quality survives.

7. **Brutalist** -- Bold concrete volumes, cantilevered sections, and dramatic massing translate well. The deliberately coarse aesthetic actually suits FDM layer lines.

**Challenging at Small Scale:**

8. **Beaux-Arts/Classical** -- Relies heavily on column orders, entablatures, sculptural elements, and fine proportional relationships that require larger scale to read.

9. **Tudor** -- Half-timbering pattern is very difficult to represent at 15mm scale. The steep gabled roofline survives, but the defining half-timber detailing does not.

10. **Organic/Gaudi-esque** -- Flowing, non-geometric forms require high-resolution printing and lose their subtlety at small scale.

### Practical Style Recommendations for Procedural Generation

For generating recognizable hotel game pieces, prioritize styles where **massing and roof form do the heavy lifting**. The generator should focus on:

1. **Varied roof profiles** -- This is the most visible differentiator between generated pieces
2. **Stepped/terraced volumes** -- Create visual interest and complex silhouettes without fine detail
3. **Entrance emphasis** -- A recessed or covered entrance is the most reliable "hotel" signifier
4. **Vertical elements** -- A tower or turret immediately suggests a landmark building
5. **Floor-line articulation** -- Simple horizontal grooves suggest multiple stories

---

## 9. Base and Pedestal Design for Stability

### Why Base Design Matters

The base is where the piece contacts the game board. A well-designed base provides:
- **Stability** against tipping
- **Flat contact** for consistent placement
- **Visual grounding** -- the piece looks "planted" rather than floating
- **Printability** -- the base is the first layer and determines print adhesion

### Base Design Options

**Option 1: Integrated Flat Base (Recommended for Simplicity)**
- The building walls extend to a common flat bottom plane
- No separate pedestal -- the building footprint IS the base
- Advantages: simple geometry, maximum contact area, easy to print
- Disadvantages: irregular footprints may wobble; building undercuts can cause instability

**Option 2: Platform/Plinth Base**
- A thin rectangular or square platform extends slightly beyond the building footprint
- Platform height: 1-2 mm; overhang: 1-2 mm on each side
- Advantages: guarantees flat contact, visually frames the building, adds perceived mass
- Disadvantages: increases footprint, may not fit tight board spaces

**Option 3: Chamfered/Beveled Base**
- The base edges are chamfered at 45 degrees
- Prevents sharp edges from catching on the board surface
- Provides a visual "shadow line" that grounds the piece
- Recommended chamfer: 0.5-1.0 mm at 45 degrees

**Option 4: Weighted Base (Advanced)**
- A hollow cavity in the base designed to accept a metal weight (washer, BB, lead shot)
- Significantly lowers center of gravity
- Provides satisfying "heft" to the piece
- Requires assembly step after printing

### Recommended Base Specifications

For this project's hotel pieces:

```
Base Type: Integrated platform with chamfer
Platform Extension: 1.0-1.5 mm beyond building footprint on all sides
Platform Height: 1.5 mm
Base Chamfer: 0.5 mm at 45 degrees on bottom edge
Bottom Surface: Flat (no texture, no recesses)
First Layer Contact: Maximum area for print adhesion
```

### Anti-Wobble Design

To prevent wobbling on imperfect surfaces:
- The base should be a single continuous plane (no legs or multiple contact points)
- Avoid any geometry that creates only 3 contact points (tripod effect = stable but tilted)
- If the building has an irregular footprint (L-shape, U-shape), extend the base to a regular rectangle
- Consider a very slight concavity (0.1mm) on the base to create a "suction cup" effect on smooth surfaces -- though this is difficult to achieve reliably with FDM

### Print Orientation and Base Quality

The base should always be the **first surface printed** (facing the build plate):
- This ensures the smoothest, flattest surface
- First-layer squish creates a slight "elephant foot" that actually improves stability
- No support material scarring on the contact surface
- The roof and upper details, which are less critical for function, are printed last

- Innovative approach to the "multiple houses per property" placement problem

**"Board Game Hotel" by tbaumann684080**
- Replacement set designed when original pieces were lost
- Available as Thing:2752839
- Practical, functional design

**"EarthQuake-Proof Monopoly House/Hotel"** (via STLFinder)
- Designed to **clip onto the edge of the board**
- Prevents pieces from falling over during gameplay
- Innovative solution to the stability problem

### The Hotel Board Game Pieces

**"Hotel Paris Lantern (Board Game Hotel by MB)"**
- Reproduces the entrance lanterns from the Hotel Paris building in the MB Hotel game
- Extremely thin and delicate; not every print succeeds
- Demonstrates the challenge of miniaturizing architectural details

**"Hotels Hotel Tycoon Boardgame Entrance"**
- Recreates entrance pieces for the classic Hotel board game
- Designed for fewer print steps than the original game components

### Tabletop Gaming Buildings (Props and Armor Curated List)

A curated collection of **20 free 3D-printable buildings** for tabletop gaming, categorized into houses, towers, castles, tombs, and miscellaneous structures. These are generally larger scale (28mm tabletop scale) but demonstrate effective approaches to miniature architecture:

- **Houses** tend to use simple rectangular volumes with peaked roofs and chimney details
- **Towers** exploit the vertical silhouette for immediate recognition
- **Castles** use crenelations and thick walls as defining features
- All prioritize printability (no supports where possible) and visual impact

### Cults3D: "Tiny House for Board Games"

- Minimalist, clean design optimized for quick printing
- No supports needed; beginner-friendly
- Scalable to fit different game scales
- Demonstrates the "less is more" principle for game-piece buildings

### Cross-Platform Observations

Common traits across successful 3D-printed game buildings:

1. **No supports required** -- the most popular designs are specifically engineered to print without supports
2. **Simple geometry** -- designs with fewer than 1000 triangles tend to be more popular and more printable
3. **Thick walls** -- minimum wall thickness of 1.2-2.0 mm for FDM reliability
4. **Bold features** -- exaggerated proportions (oversized roofs, chunky chimneys) print better than realistic proportions
5. **Flat base** -- virtually all successful designs have a single flat bottom surface
6. **Modular thinking** -- some designs allow connecting or stacking pieces

## 11. Synthesis: Design Guidelines for This Project

Based on the preceding research, the following specific guidelines should inform the procedural generation of 3D-printable miniature hotel game pieces:

### Dimensional Envelope

```
Target Height:     15-20 mm (with roof)
Target Width:      12-18 mm (facade)
Target Depth:      10-14 mm
Base Platform:     +1.5 mm height, +1.0-1.5 mm overhang per side
Total Height:      16.5-21.5 mm
Total Footprint:   14-21 mm x 12-17 mm
```

### Proportional Rules

- Height-to-width ratio: **0.8:1 to 1.3:1** (squat to slightly tall)
- Base width: at least **40% of total height** (stability)
- Roof height: **25-40% of total building height** (visual proportion)
- Building body: **60-75% of total building height**
- Entrance width: **20-35% of facade width**
- Entrance height: **25-40% of ground-floor height**

### Silhouette Requirements

- The front-view silhouette must be **distinctly non-rectangular** (must include roof form and/or entrance features)
- Each generated hotel should be **silhouette-distinguishable** from others in the batch
- Silhouette complexity (vertex count of simplified 2D outline) should be **higher for hotels than houses**
- Negative space (entry recesses, archways, balcony overhangs) should be included where printable

### Minimum Feature Sizes (FDM at 0.1mm Layer Height, 0.4mm Nozzle)

```
Minimum wall thickness:     1.2 mm (2x nozzle + overlap)
Minimum feature width:      0.8 mm (2x nozzle diameter)
Minimum embossed detail:    0.4 mm height, 0.8 mm width
Minimum engraved detail:    0.4 mm depth, 0.8 mm width
Minimum gap/slot:           0.5 mm
Minimum overhang angle:     45 degrees from vertical (without supports)
Maximum bridge span:        10 mm (with cooling)
```

### Printability Requirements

1. **No supports** -- design all geometry to be self-supporting (overhangs under 45 degrees)
2. **Print base-down** -- the building base must be the build-plate contact surface
3. **No floating geometry** -- every element must connect to the main body
4. **Minimum 1.2 mm walls** -- anything thinner risks print failure
5. **Avoid sharp internal corners** -- use fillets of at least 0.5 mm radius
6. **No thin horizontal shelves** -- awnings and canopies should be at least 1.0 mm thick

### "Hotel-ness" Checklist

A generated piece should include at least **3 of the following 6 features** to read as "hotel" rather than "house":

1. **Multiple visible stories** (2 or more floor lines on the facade)
2. **Width greater than a single-family house** (width > 14 mm)
3. **Prominent entrance** (recessed, covered, or otherwise emphasized)
4. **Symmetrical facade** (central entrance with balanced wings)
5. **Complex roofline** (not a simple single gable)
6. **Vertical element** (tower, turret, elevator shaft, or sign)

### Material and Post-Processing Recommendations

- **Default material:** PLA at 0.1 mm layer height
- **Default infill:** 20% for standard use; 100% for maximum weight/stability
- **Default color:** Red (traditional), or generate in white/gray for user painting
- **Post-processing path:** Optional sanding (400-1000 grit) and acrylic painting
- **Resin alternative:** For showcase pieces, export STL at higher resolution for SLA printing
